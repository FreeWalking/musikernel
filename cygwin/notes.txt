These are some random notes for how I built the Cygwin port, if you're not
me you can safely ignore this file :)

Step 1.  Download Cygwin setup.exe, and run with the cygwin-ports 
invokation from cygwinports.org

IT MUST BE IN C:\cygwin64 , as various scripts expect it to be there

Scipy is not an available package, but can be built with BLAS, LAPACK
and gcc-fortran

NSIS builds the Windows installer using the script in this directory

./cygwin.py builds

Building Portaudio :  It craps out several times on missing headers, but
copying those missing headers to the directory of the file that is
missing it is a quick-n-dirty fix...  The cygwinports package should
not be installed, instead it should be installed with:

./configure --prefix=/usr --with-winapi=asio,wasapi,wmme --with-asiodir=ASIO2.3
make
make install
# cd to musikernel-git/src/pydaw
cp portaudio/lib/.libs/cygportaudio-2.dll python/libpydaw/libportaudio.so
