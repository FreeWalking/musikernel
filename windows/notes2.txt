# Notes on building the Windows port using Mingw, if you're not me, and
# not trying to build the Windows port and dependencies from source, you
# can safely ignore this file

Create Windows VM (with many cores)
Install MSYS2

pacman -Sy
pacman -Su
pacman -S base-devel
pacman -S mingw-w64
pacman -S libraries
git clone https://github.com/Alexpux/MINGW-packages

# Dependencies:
python3
pyqt5
numpy
qt5 (?)
fftw
portaudio
portmidi (from where?  Or should I allow building without MIDI support?
    Or http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18156694/trying-to-build-a-portmidi-example-in-mingw)
libvorbis
libsndfile

for dependency in dependencies:
  cd dependency
  makepkg-mingw -Cfs
  cd ..

# Pacman and makepkg both break all the fucking time for no reason,
# however, they're still better than Visual Studio

# NOT YET TESTED:

MKROOT=/musikernel1

for package in packages:
  pacman -Ur ${MKROOT}  ${package}*.pkg.tar.xz  # --no-deps ?
