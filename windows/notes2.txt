Mingw notes:

Install MSYS2

pacman -Sy
pacman -Su
pacman -S base-devel
pacman -S mingw-w64
pacman -S libraries
git clone https://github.com/Alexpux/MINGW-packages

cd {dependencies, one at time}
makepkg -Cfs
...

# Pacman and makepkg both break all the fucking time for no reason,
# however, they're still better than Visual Studio
