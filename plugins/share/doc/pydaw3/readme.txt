Thank you for trying the PyDAW live DVD/USB image, below are some tips to help get you going if you're not familiar with how to use Linux audio or Ubuntu.  You may also want to Google search 'Ubuntu tutorial' if you're having trouble using it.

Some VERY important concepts of using the live USB/DVD:

1. Anything you save to your desktop or home folder while running the live USB/DVD WILL NOT BE THERE WHEN YOU REBOOT!!!  
If you created a live USB flash drive according to the instructions on the download page, and created a separate partition called "pydaw_data", then PyDAW-OS will save only your PyDAW projects and Mixxx settings to the flash drive.

If you wish to save files from any other programs, you must save them to the flash drive, for example:  /media/pydaw_data/{some_folder}/{file_name}

2.  For the best experience possible, you should install to your main hard drive rather than using live mode, although in most cases, live mode is quite usable...  Of course, live mode offers certain advantages like being able to take your projects with you on a flash drive and boot on any other computer, but installing to a hard drive has better performance and typically better reliability than a flash drive.

5.  In order to have internet in live mode, you are going to have to either plug in a network cable, or manually connect to your wireless network from the icon on the upper left of the screen, since the live USB won't remember your wireless network between boots.  If you don't need internet, you don't have to connect anything.

Firewire users:

Firewire is not officially supported or recommended.  It may be possible to get it to work, but you are on your own I'm afraid, sorry...
